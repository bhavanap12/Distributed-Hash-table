# Distributed-Hash-table

A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar 
to a hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value 
associated with a given key. Following operations are implemented:
            1) Join a new Node in the network.
            2) Set the <key,value> pair
            3) Get the value of key
            4) Delete a node from Network
